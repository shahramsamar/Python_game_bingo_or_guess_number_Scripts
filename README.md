# Python Bingo or Guess Number Game

A simple Python implementation of a Bingo or Guess the Number game, where the player tries to guess the correct number chosen by the program. The project demonstrates basic game mechanics and random number generation.

## Features

- **Guess the Number**: The player guesses the number based on clues (higher or lower).
- **Bingo Mode**: An additional Bingo game where players match numbers with a grid.
- **Interactive Interface**: A text-based interface that communicates with the player through the terminal.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shahramsamar/python_game_bingo_or_guess_number_Scripts.git
    cd python_game_bingo_or_guess_number_Scripts
    ```

2. **Run the Game:**

    ```bash
    python bingo_or_guess_number.py
    ```

### How to Play

- **Guess the Number**: 
  - The program generates a random number, and the player has to guess it.
  - After each guess, the player is told whether the guess is too high or too low.
  - The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
  
- **Bingo Mode** (if included):
  - Players select numbers to match against a bingo card, and the goal is to match all numbers in a row or column.
